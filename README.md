# The Belly Button Study

## Objective
Improbable Beef is researching for a meat alternative source. The researchers identified that the one of the several bacterias contained on the human belly button is a good candidate.

A total of 153 volunteers had their belly button bacterias colected and documented. As soon as Improbable Beef finds wich one is the one, they will have acess to the database and will be able to find the person with the ideal amount of the specific bacteria.

## Dashboard
The data is presented on a website (https://izt-gm.github.io/belly_button/) where JavaScrip was used in conjuction with HTML and CSS.

To improve visualizatio and the dynamic of the website, three graphs were created. All graphs are linked to the database and the information is ready to be used.
